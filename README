Instructions for EGit: 
***********************************************
 - Add git repo via Cloning in Eclipse     	- Use HTTPS & make sure you get the correct link from http://www.github.com/mriveralee/Wharton-Event-Planning
 - type in your GitHub username/password into the boxes below (after selecting HTTPS the boxes should become editable).
 - Perform this in terminal:
 cd ~
echo "export GIT_SSH=~/.ssh" >> .profile
- OR this in Ubuntu:
	cd ~
	echo "export GIT_SSH=/usr/bin/ssh" >> .profile
- It is recommended that Eclipse be used to edit the files and all GIT commands be performed through Terminal/the command prompt
	There seems to be issues merging using EGIT.
